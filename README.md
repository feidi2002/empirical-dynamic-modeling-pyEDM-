# Empirical Dynamic Modeling for Beginners using pyEDM

This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) techniques for beginners, adapted from *Chang et al. 2017*, using the `pyEDM` Python library.

The notebook and associated documentation cover:
- Time series simulation (Red noise, Logistic map)
- Simplex projection
- S-map analysis
- Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM)
- Univariate, Multivariate, and Multiview embeddings
- Scenario exploration and interaction strength tracking

## Figures
All figures generated by the notebook are stored in the `figures` directory. This directory contains visual representations of the results and analyses performed using the EDM techniques.

## CSV Files for Moran Model

The repository includes CSV files that are used in the implementation of the Moran model. These files contain simulated data for ecological models and are used to demonstrate the techniques of Empirical Dynamic Modeling.

- **ESM3_Data_moran.csv**: This file contains data generated from a Moran-type model, which simulates synchronous oscillations with added noise. It is used to demonstrate the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique.

- **ESM4_Data_competition.csv**: This file contains data generated from a competition-type model, which simulates mirror dynamics with added noise. It is also used in the CCM analysis to infer causal relationships between variables.

These CSV files are automatically generated using the provided Python scripts, which simulate the ecological models and save the data for further analysis.
