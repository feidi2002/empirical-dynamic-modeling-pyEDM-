# Empirical Dynamic Modeling for Beginners using pyEDM

This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) techniques for beginners, adapted from *Chang et al. 2017*, using the `pyEDM` Python library.

The notebook and associated documentation cover:
- Time series simulation (Red noise, Logistic map)
- Simplex projection
- S-map analysis
- Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM)
- Univariate, Multivariate, and Multiview embeddings
- Scenario exploration and interaction strength tracking
